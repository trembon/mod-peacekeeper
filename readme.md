# Peacekeeper module

Module for AzerothCore that will enable the player to keep a positive reputation with factions that normally are at war with each other.

**Functions:**

- You should not be able to loose reputation from any of the factions, once the Peacekeeper module is active for a faction.
- Any pre quests needed for daily quests are completed, so daily quest from both factions are available for the player.
- When you gain reputation for one faction, reputation is gained for both faction (setting).
